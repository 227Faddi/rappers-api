- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Using JavaScript to dynamically calculate and serve data (e.g., calculating ages from dates of birth).
- **Modularity:** Organizing code in a modular fashion for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling to ensure the API responds appropriately to invalid requests.
- **Documentation:** The importance of clear and comprehensive documentation for users and developers interacting with the API.
