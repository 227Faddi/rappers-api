# ðŸŽ¤ Rappers API : [Visit Here](https://rappers-api-l2wq.onrender.com/)

Rappers API is a back-end application that provides detailed information about various rappers, including their names, ages, dates of birth, and nationalities.

```json
{
    "21savage": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "ShÃ©yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph",
        "dateOfBirth": "1992-10-22",
        "age": 31,
        "nationality": "British"
    }
}
```

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express

## Usage

You can interact with the Rappers API using the following endpoints:

- [https://rappers-api-l2wq.onrender.com/api/rappers/:rapperName](https://rappers-api-l2wq.onrender.com/api/rappers/:rapperName): Retrieves data about a specific rapper.
- [https://rappers-api-l2wq.onrender.com/api/rappers](https://rappers-api-l2wq.onrender.com/api/rappers): Retrieves data for all rappers.

## Optimizations

- **Dynamic Age Calculation**: Automatically computes ages from birth dates.
- **Normalized Input**: Converts names to lowercase and removes spaces for accurate searches.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures graceful handling of errors and missing data.
